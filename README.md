# Project Booster

This is the source code for another game that I had in my head for a while! Think of [Motor Rooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyVCcVcQZNI) from Mario Party 3, but an endless version of it!

## But Why?

Why not? But realistically, I just wanted to do something fun for a change of pace and I think this could be a fun PoC to work on.

## Goals
- Controls
- Sound Design (Really the main reason why I chose that one mini game as my inspiration)
